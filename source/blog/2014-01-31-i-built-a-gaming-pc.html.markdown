I thought, seeing as the exams are over and I haven’t posted in a very long
time, that I’d put something new up.

For a time last year I thought I’d grown out of video games, it seems this is
not the case! There just wasn’t anything I really wanted to play. And now there
is. Being a loyal xbox gamer the natural choice would be: Xbox One. It can play
Titanfall, Witcher, TC The Divison and most importantly the next Halo game.
Halo is my game, more specifically, Halo Reach was my game.

I’ve now decided, after Halo-4-gate that I’m not buying the next title off
release. 343i have disappointed and they’ve got to claw it back to bring me
back. So as a protest of my frustration with Microsoft and 343i’s abuse of a
quality IP I left. I built a gaming PC and spent way too much money in the
steam Christmas sale. I’m not saying that I’ll never go back, or take on both,
just that I’m no longer going to blindly support Xbox.

Both new consoles, that’s right there are only two (side note, Nintendo need to
get out of the hardware business and push their IPs to other platforms and
distribution systems), failed to impress me. Neither has really pushed the boat
out in terms of hardware and the launch titles were a bloody joke. I don’t like
Sony because of the Geohot fiasco and Microsoft for butchering Halo so I quit.
Having Windows 8 on my pc is a necessary evil!

So [here](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/2xmMM)’s what I got myself, more than
two consoles worth of parts.

Yeah, little overkill in some places and not enough in others but I wasn’t keen
to spend over a grand - the Gene and the 350D likely being the biggest
luxuries.

I started out with Torchlight II, a top-down RPG, it was quite good fun and I
played it for about 10 hours before I moved on temporarily. I found it was
getting a little repetitive and seemed to require little skill. Player
progression was a little boring and you tended to be better to level a single
skill or weapon. I did like the visual style though, and it was admitted a good
story with a wide range of play spaces. I will go back to it in time.

Following that I started messing around with free-to-play titles. I tried
Blacklight and Planetside out and stuck with Blacklight. This was my first go
with the WASD control method in a big way and while it was fun I found that
years or console gaming had set me back. The community chants that it’s _not
pay to win_ and it’s not as bad as some there’s certainly enough of that to put
me off a little. It was a nice looking game but the micro transactions system
was quite oddly laid out.

I then moved on to Assassins Creed IV. I got it free with my GTX 770 from Scan.
The only issue initially was the 23GB download! It’s the biggest download I’ve
ever completed. I’m glad I can say it’s been worth the wait. It’s a really good
looking game and I’m getting good fun out of it. It did seem to break my
computer a few times, and not through overheating. It was a really bizarre
issue that I still don’t quite understand, it appears to have been some driver
issue. I’m quite happy that after [much fiddling
around](http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?p=3483715) it seems to have
gone away. Annoyingly I lost a 4 hour save and had to start again. I will make
sure I still finish the main story at least and I have already started again.

For whatever reason I thought it was time to experiment yet again. I downloaded
Dota 2. At the time of writing I’ve only played 5 games but I am really
starting to enjoy it. It’s been quite overwhelming, there are just far to many
things to think about as a beginner. Which hero is the major one, there are
over 100 each ranked on about 10 very different and important attributes. Some
are really item dependant, many are only for certain play styles and some that
just aren’t for noobs. They’re well balanced but it seems everyone has
different advice on the matter. It’s a real minefield but one I’m keen to
puzzle out. It’s crazy that it’s free too, not really sure how Valve gets
enough from it to make it worth their time.

So that’s the story of my conversion to PC gaming, so far so good.
